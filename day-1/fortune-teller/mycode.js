// The Fortune Teller

/*
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
Store the following into variables:

number of children
partner's name
geographic location
job title

Output your fortune to the console like so: "You will be a X in Y, andmarried to Z with N kids.
*/

var children = 2;
var partner = "Eric";
var place = "Oslo, Norway";
var job = "Web Developer";

console.log("You will be a " + job + " in " + place + ", married to " + partner + " with " + children + " kids.")
