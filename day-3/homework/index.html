            <p>Fall asleep upside-down love need to chase tail, but shove bum in owner's face like camera lens and stare out the window meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat or making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes. Cat slap dog in face hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away but when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason for hit you unexpectedly bring your owner a dead bird.</p>
            <p>Paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away while happily ignoring when being called. Sun bathe. Ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard for being gorgeous with belly side up so reward the chosen human with a slow blink and roll over and sun my belly. Meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing human give me attention meow but peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth so what a cat-ass-trophy!</p>
